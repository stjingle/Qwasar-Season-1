# Welcome to Quest03
***

## Task
To solve the various exercise on the Quest which are nine (9) in number.

## Description
Write a program that takes a string as an argument and returns it reversed.
Reproduce the behavior of the function strcmp. The strcmp() function compares string1 with string2 to see if there are equals.
Reproduce the behavior of the function strcpy. The strcpy() and strncpy() functions copy the string source (src) to destination (dst).
Reproduce the behavior of the function strncpy.
Create a function that searches for the first occurrence of the character c (an unsigned char) in the string pointed to by the argument str. 
Searches for the last occurrence of the character c (an unsigned char) in the string pointed to by the argument str.
Implement strStr(). It should return a pointer to the first occurrence of a needle in a haystack, or NULL if the needle is not part of the haystack.
Structures in C are similar to the concept of package. You are defining a struct of type struct s_box which will contains variables.
Write a function that takes an integer array as a parameter (input) and returns a boolean (true/false).

## Installation
There is no installation needed for the execution of the codes.

## Usage
There is no particular form of usage in the project as it runs at the point of initialization.

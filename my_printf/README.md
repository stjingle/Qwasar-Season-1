# Welcome to My Printf
***

## Task
Write a command program for the my_printf function

## Description
The my_printf() function produce output according to a format as described below. The my_printf() functions write output to stdout, the standard output stream;

This function writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not PERCENT), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

## Installation
No any form of Installation implemented for the project to be executed.

## Usage
Each conversion specification is introduced by the PERCENT character. The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier. After the PERCENT, the following appear in sequence:

doux The int (or appropriate variant) argument is converted to signed decimal (d). unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), unsigned hexadecimal (x).
c The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
s The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL character.
p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
